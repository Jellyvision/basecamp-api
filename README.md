[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jellyvision/basecamp-api.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Jellyvision/basecamp-api)

Still a work in progress, but building with testcases so you can see how easy it is to use.

Phase 1 is to support the classic API.
Phase 2 will add support for the new API.
