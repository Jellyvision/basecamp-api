[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jellyvision/basecamp-api.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Jellyvision/basecamp-api)

Still a work in progress, but building with testcases so you can see how easy it is to use.

* Phase 1 is to support the [classic API](https://github.com/basecamp/basecamp-classic-api).
* Phase 2 will add support for the [new API](https://github.com/basecamp/bcx-api).
